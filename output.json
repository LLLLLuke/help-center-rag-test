Why might this be the case? --- There are two main reasons why the final amount received might differ from your original payment. Firstly, if you are depositing in a currency other than USD, a currency conversion will likely occur, and the exchange rate applied can cause a difference. Secondly, some payment methods may impose their own transaction fees, which would also reduce the final amount credited to your account."
